                <h1>About Me</h1>
            
                <p>I’m Ali Aboelela, a third year computer engineering student at the University of Toronto. I was born in Egypt but lived in Saudi Arabia until 2019 when I moved to Toronto. I’m currently interested in the fields of AI and IoT; particularly in the impact they’ll have on the Agritech and Renewables industries.
                    Outside of university and work I enjoy the outdoors, biking, and cooking for my friends. Growing up my family was fortunate enough to travel around the world. I’ve inherited my parents' spirit for travel and would love to continue learning about the world’s cultures and seeing its beautiful lands.
                    </p>
